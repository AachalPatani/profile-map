# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

The key functionalities of the application include:
1. Profile Display: Create a webpage that presents a collection of profiles,
each comprising essential information such as the person's name,
photograph, and a brief description.
2. Interactive Mapping: Incorporate an interactive map component that can
dynamically display addresses based on user interactions. This map will
allow users to see the geographical location associated with each profile.
3. Summary Integration: Implement a "Summary" button adjacent to each
profile. Clicking this button should trigger the display of the map
component with a marker indicating the precise address of the selected
profile.
4. User-Friendly Experience: Ensure that the application offers a smooth and
intuitive user experience, enabling users to easily navigate profiles and
access mapped addresses without confusion.
5. Profile Data Management : Allow administrators to add, edit, or delete
profiles.
6. Search and Filter Functionality : Provide users with the ability to search and
filter profiles based on different criteria, such as name, location, or other
attributes. This enhances the usability of the application.
7. Responsive Design : Ensure that the application is responsive and
mobile-friendly so that users can access it from various devices, including
smartphones and tablets.
8. Error Handling Implement robust error handling and validation
mechanisms to handle issues gracefully, such as invalid addresses or
failed map service requests.
9. Loading Indicators : Include loading indicators of progress bars to give
users feedback when the application is fetching data or rendering the map.
10. Profile Details: Create a separate profile details view that provides more
in-depth information about each profile when a user clicks on a profile
card. This can include additional details like contact information, interests,
etc.
